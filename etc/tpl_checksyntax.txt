*checksyntax.txt*   checksyntax -- Check syntax when saving a file (php, ruby, tex ...)
                    Author: Tom Link, micathom at gmail com

The checksyntax plugin runs an external syntax checker for the current buffer 
whenever the buffer is saved (by calling the |:CheckSyntax| command). Syntax 
errors are managed as location or quickfix lists. If any syntax error occurs, 
the |location-list| is opened (users can redefine |CheckSyntaxFail()| to change 
this behaviour). You can use any |location-list| related command to navigate 
the list of syntax errors.

If quickfixsigns (vimscript #2584) is installed, lines containing syntax errors 
will be marked with signs.

Experimental: If AsyncCommand (vimscript #3431) is installed, syntax checks can 
be peformed asynchronously -- see also |g:checksyntax#run_alternatives|, 
|g:checksyntax#run_all_alternatives| and |g:checksyntax#async_runner|.

By default, |:CheckSyntax| is mapped to <F5> (if not mapped already), 
and automatically executed when saving the buffer. :CheckSyntax! or <C-F5> will 
run all syntax checkers for a given filetype if multiple alternatives are 
defined and installed on your computer.

The |:CheckSyntax| command takes one optional argument: the mode (default: 
&filetype).

As the plugin doesn't provide syntax checks by its own. This is done by 
an external syntax checker that has to be installed on your computer.

Pre-defined syntax checkers (the respective syntax checker has to 
be installed):

  c, cpp       ... Requires splint
  html         ... Requires tidy
  java         ... Requires
                    jlint (http://jlint.sourceforge.net),
                    checkstyle (http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net),
                    pmd (http://pmd.sourceforge.net)
  javascript   ... Syntax check; requires jshint, esprima, 
                   gjslint, jslint, jsl, pmd
  lua          ... Requires luac (run luac -p)
  php          ... Syntax check; requires php (run php -l)
  python       ... Requires pyflakes or pylint
  r            ... Requires codetools::checkUsage, lint::lint, or 
                   svTools::lint
  ruby         ... Requires ruby (run ruby -c)
  tex, latex   ... Requires chktex (run chktex -q -v0)
  viki         ... Requires deplate
  xhtml        ... Requires tidy
  xml, docbk   ... Requires xmllint, pmd

Syntax checker definitions are kept in:
autoload/checksyntax/defs/{&filetype}.vim

Run this command to find out, which filetypes are supported: >
  :echo globpath(&rtp, 'autoload/checksyntax/defs/*.vim')

This plugin was originally based on Klaus Horsten's php_console 
(vimscript #779) and it is the successor of php_check_syntax.vim 
(vimscript #1272).
